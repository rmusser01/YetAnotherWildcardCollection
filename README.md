(Forked from LulzRose's) YetAnotherWildcardCollection
=============

[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/unlicense)

This is a compilation of more than a dozen wildcard collections pruned for any errors and duplicates and organized for ease of use. This fork is focused on non-NSFW entries. All NSFW entries I've come across while compiling this have been dumped into the NSFW folder. It's unsorted. My goal was to consolidate all the wildcard dumps I could find, but dind't want to necessarily throw some away because I personally don't want them, so instead they just go into the NSFW folder.

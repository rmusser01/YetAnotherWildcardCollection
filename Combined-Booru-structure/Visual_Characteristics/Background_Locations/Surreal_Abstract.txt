Floating islands in a colorful, dreamlike sky.
A room with floating, oversized furniture.
A world made entirely of candy and sweets.
A world of floating, geometric shapes.
A canvas of surreal, melting landscapes.
A kaleidoscope of colors and patterns merging.
A place with a morbid look that resembles a funeral a little foggy
An old place full of cracks, misplaced things and broken pieces

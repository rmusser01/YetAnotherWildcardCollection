A deserted highway with overgrown vegetation.
A group of survivors in a makeshift desert camp.
The ruins of a once-thriving metropolis.
A place infested with bugs and worms with decaying woods
A hurricane-ravaged environment with lots of broken glass and scattered items
A place battered by time and natural disasters
A place forgotten by the world
A valley forgotten by time

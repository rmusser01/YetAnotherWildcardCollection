Wildcards! You can now create wildcard files and use them. You can manage the entirely in the UI, -or- just go store some .txt files into Swarm/Data/Wildcards (or configure the path in server settings).

Use in a prompt like <wildcard:animals>, or just click the card in the UI.

Wildcard files are simple text - one entry per line.
Wildcards can contain prompt-syntax (eg another wildcard inside the wildcard, or a preset, or whatever you want)
Use # to comment a line (not count in the options list).

### <a name="writeprompt"></a>Writing Prompts
- **Sample Structure**
	- `[image content/subject, description of action, state, and mood] / B.[art form, style, and artist references] / C.[additional settings, such as lighting, colors, and framing]`
 		* `[image content/subject]` - The choice of image content or subject defines what the image is about. It provides the primary focus and narrative of the visual. Whether it's a natural landscape, a person, an object, or an abstract concept, the subject sets the stage for the viewer's understanding and emotional response. 
 		* `description of action` - The action in an image represents what's happening within the visual. Action can range from dynamic and energetic movements to static and contemplative scenes. It adds life and depth to the image, influencing the viewer's perception of the moment captured. 
		* `state` - The state of objects, people, or elements in an image conveys their condition or position. States can be descriptive in terms of physical attributes or emotional states. 
		* `art form` - Different art forms, such as illustration, painting, photography, or graphic design, provide a framework for conveying ideas and emotions. When choosing an art form for image prompts, it sets the medium through which the message or concept will be visualized.
 		* `style` - Artistic style encompasses the unique visual language of an artist or a genre. It plays a crucial role in conveying the mood, tone, and atmosphere of an image. 
		* `artist` - Referencing specific artists or their works can provide a rich source of inspiration and context. Artists often have signature techniques, themes, and visual motifs that can be used to guide the creation of images. 
		* `lighting` - Lighting profoundly influences the mood, depth, and emphasis within an image. The choice of lighting can range from natural daylight to dramatic and moody settings. It impacts the visibility of details, the presence of shadows, and the overall ambiance.
		* `colors` - The color palette in an image can convey emotions, symbolism, and themes. The selection of colors influences the visual harmony and can create stark contrasts or subtle tonal variations. 
 		* `framing` - Framing dictates the composition and perspective of the image. It can range from close-up shots to wide-angle views and various angles. 
 	- Example:
		* `A serene forest glade, A fox resting beneath a sun-dappled oak tree, its tail curled around its body in contentment, Peaceful and contemplative, Watercolor,  Impressionist, Inspired by the works of Claude Monet, particularly "Water Lilies", Soft, diffused morning sunlight filtering through the leaves, A pastel palette dominated by shades of green, with hints of pink and blue in the flowers, A wide-angle view capturing the entire forest glade, with the fox as the central focus`

- **Alternative Sample Structure**
	- Structure: `{Medium/+ opt. Mod/Main style}`,`{Object/Subject}`,`{Details}`,`{Background}`,`{Mods/Embeddings}`
		* `{Medium/+ opt. Mod/Main style}` - What medium and style to use?
		* `{Object/Subject}` - What will be the focus of the image?
		* `{Details}` - What level of detail should be used?
		* `{Background}` - What is in the background/setting for the picture?
